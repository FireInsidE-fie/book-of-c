# The book of C

This is just a little repo of me creating little programs while following the book "The C Programming Language, second edition",
otherwise referenced as "The book of C" in this repo.

Programs in the `references` folders are copies from the book of C which I may have modified to add more features and learn a little instead of just copying blindly.

Programs in the `exercises` folders are the ones I wrote by myself following a prompt of the book, for example exercise 1.4 page 16.
