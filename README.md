# The book of C

This is just a little repo of me creating little programs while following the book "The C Programming Language, second edition",
otherwise referenced as "The book of C" in this repo.
I also started reading beej's guide to C, available here[https://beej.us/guide/bgc/pdf/bgc_a4_c_1.pdf].

Programs in the `references` folders are copies from the book of C which I may have modified to add more features and learn a little instead of just copying blindly.

Programs in the `exercises` folders are the ones I wrote by myself following a prompt of the book, for example exercise 1.4 page 16.

Any programs at the root of a chapter folder are there because I wrote them unprompted by the book but while reading a specific chapter. It's just so I can experiment and write some cool stuff!
